/**
 * This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Write the function circleArea/CircleArea which takes in a Circle object and calculates the area of that circle.
The Circle class can be seen below:

//P.R.E.P
 
 **/

//Parameter = a value will be given, the value will be a number. 

//Return - return to the console the answer

//Example - if a radius of 5 is given, than 79.54 must be notified to the console

function circleArea(radius){
    // the area of a circle being pi r square

    //everything should fit into one singular line

    console.log(Math.PI*radius**2)
  }

  circleArea(5)


//this was in the example but it just made things more confusing 

//   class Circle {
//     constructor(center, radius) { 
//       this.center = center; 
//       this.radius = radius;
//     }
//   }
